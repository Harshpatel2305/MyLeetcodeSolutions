# MyLeetcodeSolutions

A curated collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems — with clean code, clear explanations, and learning notes.

> **Goal:** Build strong problem-solving skills by organizing solutions by topic, tracking progress, and reflecting on patterns and trade-offs.

## 🧩 How I Write Each Solution

Every solution includes:
- **Approach & intuition** (why this works, key idea, and patterns used)
- **Time & space complexity**
- **Edge cases**
- **Code** with comments
- **Optional**: alt approaches (e.g., brute force vs optimized)


> I often use `py` on Windows (same as my local workflow).

## 🧭 How I Practice (and what I’m focusing on)

- Start with brute force, **then** optimize.
- Identify pattern early: sliding window, two pointers, prefix sums, etc.
- Write down complexity before coding.
- Add 2–3 **sanity tests** per solution.
- Reflect in the per-problem README: “What tripped me up?”

> Current focus: **sliding window, two pointers, hash map** (my common interview set).

## 🔁 Roadmap

- [ ] Add C++/Java versions for popular problems
- [ ] Add benchmarking script for runtime comparisons
- [ ] Add explanations with visuals where helpful
- [ ] Automate problem scaffolding with a CLI (create folder + template)
- [ ] Add CI (run tests on push via GitHub Actions)
